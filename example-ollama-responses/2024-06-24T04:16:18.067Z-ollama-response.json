It was founded in 2011 by Andrea Kmenta, David Gianotto, and Mark Zahler, and has since grown into a widely used platform for UI/UX designers, developers, and other professionals involved in the design process.\n\nFigma is known for its collaboration features, which allow multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously, making it easy for teams to share ideas and get feedback in real-time. It also has a large library of pre-made components, such as buttons, icons, and form fields, that designers can use to speed up their workflow.\n\nFigma offers both a free version and a paid version with more advanced features, including access to beta versions of new tools and the ability to collaborate on larger projects. It is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":2021298900,"load_duration":7500700,"prompt_eval_count":9,"prompt_eval_duration":116852000,"eval_count":224,"eval_duration":1891154000}
