They are known for their agility, gracefulness and hunting skills, which have made them both companions and working animals throughout history.

However, some domestic cats may also enjoy exploring the outdoors or roaming around their neighborhoods.\nCats are divided into two categories: wildcats and house cats. Wildcats are found in various habitats across the world, such as forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains, while house cats are domesticated by humans for companionship, pest control, or other practical purposes.\nCats have a reputation for being independent and aloof animals, but they can also be very affectionate and social with their owners or other pets in the household. They are known to groom themselves regularly, which helps them maintain cleanliness and hygiene. Cats also have excellent senses of vision, hearing, and smell, which enable them to navigate through various environments and detect potential threats or prey.\nOverall, cats are fascinating animals with unique personalities and behaviors that make them popular pets for many people around the world."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":2556867200,"load_duration":10345300,"prompt_eval_count":15,"prompt_eval_duration":119218000,"eval_count":290,"eval_duration":2421296000}
