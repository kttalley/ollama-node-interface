It was founded in 2011 by four former Google employees - Marley Rogers, David Grubb, Eric Hollmann, and Tyson deRooij - and has since grown into a popular platform for design professionals around the world.\n\nFigma allows users to create wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes, and interactive demos of their designs using a drag-and-drop interface. It supports a wide range of file formats and integrates with other tools such as Sketch and InVision for additional functionality. Figma also offers collaboration features that enable teams to work together on projects in real-time, share files, and provide feedback on each other's designs.\n\nIn addition to its desktop version, Figma has a mobile app that allows designers to access their projects from anywhere using Apple or Android devices. The app includes many of the same features as the desktop version, including the ability to create and edit designs, collaborate with team members, and access project files on-the-go."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":2277686400,"load_duration":7994500,"prompt_eval_duration":105067000,"eval_count":255,"eval_duration":2159021000}
