It has since evolved into the ATX II specification, which was released in 2004 and includes additional features such as power management capabilities. The ATX standard defines dimensions, power supply locations, mounting points, and other requirements for computer cases and motherboards to ensure compatibility between different components.\n\nMotherboard manufacturers must follow the ATX specification when designing their products, but they can also add their own features or modifications on top of it. Some examples include additional expansion slots, front panel connectors, and audio jacks.\n\nIn summary, an ATX motherboard is a type of computer motherboard that follows the Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX) standard developed by Intel to ensure compatibility with various components and provide consistency in design across different systems."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":1521303200,"load_duration":7852300,"prompt_eval_count":61,"prompt_eval_duration":25186000,"eval_count":194,"eval_duration":1477923000}
